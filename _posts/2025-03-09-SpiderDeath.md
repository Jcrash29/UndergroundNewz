Reports are coming in from Midgard that a local arachnid retreat was massacre by an unknown adventuring party. 

One surviving spider was quoted as saying "We came here trying to be nice, and they killed us". coarpses littered the nearby floor. 

It appears the assailants attempted to cover up their deed by setting fire to the nearby forest.
